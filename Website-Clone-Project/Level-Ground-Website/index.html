                <p>In addition to athletics, Level Ground provides college access and career opportunities to Boston youth. Our young people are exposed to a disproportionately high level of poverty and crime, and live in neighborhoods that experience a greater prevalence of obesity-related illnesses. From assistance with college applications to employment at our gym, access to our weekly nutrition workshops, and free athletic training, Level Ground strives to meet the needs of our youth in an authentic and compassionate manner.</p>
